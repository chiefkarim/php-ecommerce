# Project Rules

- Backend code lives in `api/`.
- Frontend code lives in `client/`.
- Use PHP `8.2` for backend.
- Use namespace `App\\` in backend code.
- Database target is MySQL `8.0.45`.
- Use only one DB environment variable: `DATABASE_URL`.
- Frontend styling uses Tailwind CSS with reusable modular base components.
- Commit regularly with Conventional Commits and include commit body (`why`, `what`, `impact`).
- Keep each commit under 1000 lines of code changed.
